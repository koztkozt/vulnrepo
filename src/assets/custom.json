For example, web servers will need to write to the logs they use, but they do not actually need to write to the rotated logs, which means that the file permissions can be changed at rotation time to prevent the web server process from modifying them.\n\n- Some servers may rotate logs when they reach a certain size.

A large number of them coming from the same source could indicate that a CGI scanning tool is being used against the web server.\n\n- 50x (server error) messages.

The best protection is to limit the amount of resources that an unauthorized user can cause to be expended. A strong authentication and access control model will help prevent such attacks from occurring in the first place, and it will help the administrator to identify who is committing the abuse. The login application should be protected against DoS attacks as much as possible. Limiting the database access, perhaps by caching result sets, can help minimize the resources expended. To further limit the potential for a DoS attack, consider tracking the rate of requests received from users and blocking requests that exceed a defined rate threshold.- Ensure that protocols have specific limits of scale placed on them.- For any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid 602: Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.\nImplementation- Assume all input is malicious. Use an \"accept known good\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.- When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, \"boat\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colours such as \"red\" or \"blue.\"- Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation.

The password recovery mechanism is frequently unreliable, which increases the likelihood that someone besides the system's legitimate user will be able to access that user's account. A strong password authentication scheme is completely destroyed by weak password recovery procedures.\nThis weakness may exist due to the security question being too easy to guess (e.g., because the question is too common, or the answers can be found using social networks). There may also be an implementation weakness in the code of the password recovery mechanism that may, for instance, trick the system into emailing the new password to an email account other than the user's email account. The password reset rate may not be regulated, so a legitimate user may be denied of service if an attacker attempts to recover his or her password in quick succession. The system can send the original password to the user instead of generating a new temporary password. In summary, password recovery functionality, if not carefully designed and implemented, can often become the weakest link in the system that can be misused in a way that allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system.\n\n**Potential Impact:**\n- Access Control: Gain Privileges or Assume Identity: An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the system by retrieving legitimate user's authentication credentials\n\n- Availability: DoS: Resource Consumption : An attacker could deny service to legitimate system users by launching a brute force attack on the password recovery mechanism using user ids of legitimate users.\n\n- Other: Other: The system's security functionality is turned against the system by the attacker.",

      "recommendations": "When sending passwords via email, the following areas should be reviewed:\n- Is the user forced to change the password upon first login? The new password is sent via unencrypted email, and may remain in the user's inbox indefinitely if the user does not delete the email. Therefore, the user should be required to change the password upon first login.\n\n- Is the password generated securely? The password should be generated using a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG), and should be long enough to prevent password guessing or brute force attacks. For a secure user experience, it should be generated using a secure passphrase style approach (i.e., combining multiple words), rather than a random string of characters.\n\n- Is the user's current password sent? Instead of generating a new password for the user, some applications send the users their current password. This is a very insecure method, as it exposes your current password via unencrypted email. Furthermore, if the site is able to retrieve the existing password, this implies that passwords are stored using reversible encryption, or (more likely) in unencrypted plaintext, which represents a serious security weakness.\n\n- Are emails sent from a domain with anti-spoofing protection? The domain must implement SPF, DKIM and DMARC to prevent attackers from spoofing emails coming from it, which could be used as part of a social engineering attack.\n\n- Is email considered secure enough? Emails are often sent unencrypted and, in many cases, the user's email account will not be protected by MFA. In addition, it may be shared among multiple individuals, especially in a corporate environment.\n\nConsider whether email-based password reset functionality is appropriate based on the context of the application being tested.",

Instead of solely depending on role based authentication methods using sessions, we rather want to assign privileges to users by means of a Database-Based Authentication system.\n\nWe still use sessions in order to identify if the user was logged in correctly, only now instead of assigning that user with a specific role we assign him with privileges to verify which actions he is privileged to perform on the system.Also, a big pro of this method is, whenever a user has to be assigned fewer privileges your changes will be applied on the fly since the assigning does not depend on the session which otherwise had to expire first.",

As an example of business rule logic, \"\"boat\"\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colours such as \"red\" or \"blue.\" Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation.

Properly quote arguments and escape any special characters within those arguments. The most conservative approach is to escape or filter all characters that do not pass an extremely strict whitelist (such as everything that is not alphanumeric or white space). If some special characters are still needed, such as white space, wrap each argument in quotes after the escaping/filtering step. Be careful of argument injection (88).\n\n- Inputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated (180).

      "desc": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it. Stored attacks are those where the injected script is permanently stored on the target servers, such as in a database, in a message forum, visitor log, comment field, etc. The victim then retrieves the malicious script from the server when it requests the stored information. Stored XSS is also sometimes referred to as Persistent or Type-I XSS.\n\n**Potential Impact:**\n- Confidentiality: Read Application Data: The most common attack performed with cross-site scripting involves the disclosure of information stored in user cookies. Typically, a malicious user will craft a client-side script, which -- when parsed by a web browser -- performs some activity (such as sending all site cookies to a given E-mail address). This script will be loaded and run by each user visiting the web site. Since the site requesting to run the script has access to the cookies in question, the malicious script does also.\n\n- Availability: Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands: In some circumstances it may be possible to run arbitrary code on a victim's computer when cross-site scripting is combined with other flaws.\n\n- Access Control: Read Application Data: The consequence of an XSS attack is the same regardless of whether it is stored or reflected. The difference is in how the payload arrives at the server. XSS can cause a variety of problems for the end user that range in severity from an annoyance to complete account compromise. Some cross-site scripting vulnerabilities can be exploited to manipulate or steal cookies, create requests that can be mistaken for those of a valid user, compromise confidential information, or execute malicious code on the end user systems for a variety of nefarious purposes.

The result is that the data goes through secure input validation and the functions are secure.\n\n- Phase: Implementation. Explicitly define a final() object to avoid deserialization.\n\n- Phases: Architecture and Design; Implementation. Make fields transient to protect them from deserialization. An attempt to serialize and then deserialize a class containing transient fields will result in NULLs where the transient data should be. This is a great way to prevent temporary, environment, or sensitive variables from being transferred and misused.\n\n- Phase: Implementation.

Typically, a malicious user will craft a client-side script, which -- when parsed by a web browser -- performs some activity (such as sending all site cookies to a given E-mail address).

The difference is in how the payload arrives at the server. XSS can cause a variety of problems for the end user that range in severity from an annoyance to complete account compromise. Some cross-site scripting vulnerabilities can be exploited to manipulate or steal cookies, create requests that can be mistaken for those of a valid user, compromise confidential information, or execute malicious code on the end user systems for a variety of nefarious purposes.

Generally speaking, however, the most effective way to prevent DOM-based vulnerabilities is to prevent data from any untrusted source from dynamically altering the value that is passed to any receiver.\nIf the desired functionality of the application means that this behavior is unavoidable, then defenses must be implemented within client-side code. In many cases, relevant data can be validated against a whitelist, allowing only content that is known to be safe. In other cases, it will be necessary to sanitize or encrypt the data.
